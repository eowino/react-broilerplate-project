React broilerplate example project (Trollo)
============================================

React broilerplate consists stuff that I use and vampirize to start new projects.
Maintaining it seems to be a full-time job. Thanks, Obama!

This is an example starter project utilizing the stuff I now put in NPM.

Pull requests are accepted. If you vampirize this, vampirize something back
please! :D

Use as you wish, but still read the license from LICENSE.
